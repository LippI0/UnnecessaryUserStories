Story:
As a Flying Person I want to make a reservation for the toilet from my seat so I donâ€™t have to stand in line without space.

Kontext: 
Waiting in line is always a pain, but especially in a plane as there is only limited space within the middle lane and in front of the toilet. 
On the other hand most planes have entertainment systems which would allow an integration of a booking system for every passenger.

Acceptance Criteria:
- I am able to make a reservation 
- no waiting time and no stumbling into each other on the way
- accessibility to all passengers


Out of Scope:
